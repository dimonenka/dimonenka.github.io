  <h2 style="color: inherit">Personal Statement</h2>
  
  On February 24th, 2022, Russian forces invaded Ukraine.
  It took me a while to even realize what had happened and what the consequences might be.
  But a week later, I left my hometown of St. Petersburg with my wife out of concern about getting drafted 
  to fight in an unjust, cruel, and unnecessary war.
  
  We went to visit my wife's parents in Kazakhstan -- a `short vacation' as we declared to border control.
  The decision was made spontaneously. 
  As we woke up one day, we found and bought flight tickets for the evening, having only few hours to pack.
  This is not an uncommon story.
  
  The company I was working for, JetBrains, openly condemned the war and made plans to leave the country in a month.
  I was offered a relocation package but declined.
  
  Few months went by. Feeling no immediate threat, we returned to St. Petersburg.
  Life was eerily unchanged, apart from vomit-inducing banners with a letter `Z'.
  
  I was fortunate to get a postdoctoral position at Technion in Haifa, Israel.
  My starting date and the day we relocated was September 20th, which is also my birthday.
  On September 21st, Russia began a massive military recruitment, causing a second mass relocation wave.
  We dodged this bullet by one day. I still haven't been back.
  
  In Israel, I was hoping to heal mentally and focus on professional development. 
  One can imagine how that went.
  
  Again, it took us about a week to decide to go on a short vacation -- this time to Istanbul.
  We came back in only a few weeks -- perhaps being more experienced.
  Despite the still looming threat of war escalation and acts of terror, 
  the prospects of returning to Russia even temporarily seem as dangerous, so we are staying put.
  
  However difficult, I try to stay positive and focus on advancing my academic career.
  Turning down relocation in favour of the uncertainty in the early days of war was not easy,
  but I was confident in my ability to find a better position that allows me to continue research.
  Which I did.
  To my ability, I make an effort to meet new people and engage in new projects.
  I am proud of the research I've contributed to in the past few years.
  
  I want to deeply and sincerely thank all my friends who have and continue to care, support, and help.
  Fedor Sandomirsky who proactively referred me to his former colleagues in Technion.
  Herve Moulin who wrote me a recommendation letter despite us not working on any joint projects.
  My PhD advisor, Alexander Nesterov, who always offered me advice and a place at the Game Theory lab in HSE University.
  My Israeli colleagues, Omer Ben-Porat and Inbal Talgam-Cohen, 
  who expressed compassion and eagerness to help despite being incomparably more affected by the despicable events of October 7th.
  My international colleagues, David Parkes, Paul Duetting, and Tonghan Wang, who offered sympathy as events were unfolding.
  My wife Xenia who is staying by my side.
  And our cat Beba who is a consistent source of dopamine and scratches.

I am a research scientist in **AI and Game Theory**, including **Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning** 
with a focus on **incentive alignment** and **cooperation**, as well as **Automated Mechanism Design**.

Currently, I am a postdoc in the 
<a href="https://dds.technion.ac.il/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Data and Decision Sciences</a>
faculty at Technion in Haifa, Israel.
Prior to this, I pursued my doctoral studies at the Higher School of Economics in St. Petersburg, Russia, 
where I am expected to obtain a PhD in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning later in 2024. 
I was doing research in the
<a href="https://game.hse.ru/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Game Theory and Decision Making</a>
lab at the Higher School of Economics, as well as in the Reinforcement Learning unit of JetBrains Research.

<h2 style="color: inherit">Research Interests</h2>

My research lies at the intersection of AI and Game Theory, focusing on two main directions.

One direction is to apply methods of Machine Learning to economic problems.
As a notable example, automated design of economic mechanisms 
employs data-driven ML approaches to discover 
(approximately) optimal mechanisms with desirable properties, 
moving beyond traditional reliance on theorems and proofs.
In this area, I have contributed to auction and contract design through deep learning.

The other direction is to take an economic perspective on AI problems.
This implies treating AI agents as entities with inherent incentives and preferences,
which we cannot modify directly, but can influence externally through designed mechanisms -- 
rules governing their interactions with the world, each other, and us.
This concept I study through the lens of Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning.

Despite the rising concerns in academy and society alike, I do not believe in the imminence of
Artificial General Intelligence. Still, by the principles of
<a href="https://arbital.com/p/orthogonality/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">orthogonality</a> and 
<a href="https://arbital.com/p/instrumental_convergence/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">instrumental convergence</a>, 
it is inevitable, and ensuring its safety and alignment with our values (whatever that means) is vital.
Given that Game Theory, Mechanism Design, and related fields explicitly concern alignment of incentives,
integrating these fields into AI research is a necessary precursor towards safe AGI.


<h2 style="color: inherit">Achievements</h2>

In 2020, I received a 
<a href="https://yandex.com/scholarships/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Yandex ML Prize</a>
award based on my
<a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3328526.3329642" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">EC publication</a>.
Yandex, an international IT company, annually awards a handful of young researchers (typically, students) 
from Russia and neighboring countries with monetary prizes and research grants. 
The applications are reviewed based on the scientific contribution of the published research, 
as well as a behavioral interview. That year, nine researchers were awarded.

I was also a part of a
<a href="https://discourse.aicrowd.com/t/neurips-2020-flatland-winners/4010" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">team</a>
that placed first in the 
<a href="https://www.aicrowd.com/challenges/flatland" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Flatland</a>
Multi-Agent RL competition at NeurIPS 2020.
The task was to manage dense traffic in a simulated environment of complex railway networks, 
requiring planning and coordination. Our solution is described in a 
<a href="https://proceedings.mlr.press/v133/laurent21a/laurent21a.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">publication</a>
at the NeurIPS competition track (Section 4.2).
