I am a postdoc in the 
<a href="https://dds.technion.ac.il/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Data and Decision Sciences</a>
faculty at Technion in Haifa, Israel.
Prior to this, I pursued my doctoral studies at the Higher School of Economics in St. Petersburg, Russia, 
where I am expected to obtain a PhD in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning later in 2024. 
I was doing research in the
<a href="https://game.hse.ru/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Game Theory and Decision Making</a>
lab at the Higher School of Economics, as well as in the Reinforcement Learning unit of JetBrains Research.

<h3 style="color: inherit">Research Interests</h3>

My research lies at the intersection of Artificial Intelligence and Game Theory, focusing on two main directions.

One direction is to apply methods of Machine Learning to economic problems.
As a notable example, automated design of economic mechanisms 
employs data-driven ML approaches to discover 
(approximately) optimal mechanisms with desirable properties, 
moving beyond traditional reliance on theorems and proofs.
In this area, I have contributed to auction and contract design through deep learning.

The other direction is to take an economic perspective on AI problems.
This implies treating AI agents as entities with inherent incentives and preferences,
which we cannot modify directly, but can influence externally through designed mechanisms -- 
rules governing their interactions with the world, each other, and us.
This concept I study through the lens of Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning.

I believe that Artificial General Intelligence is an inevitability (by 
<a href="https://arbital.com/p/orthogonality/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">orthogonality</a> and 
<a href="https://arbital.com/p/instrumental_convergence/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">instrumental convergence</a>), 
but safe AGI with values aligned to ours (whatever that means) is the true grand challenge.
Given that Game Theory and Mechanism Design explicitly concern alignment of incentives,
integrating these fields into AI research is a necessary precursor towards safe AGI.
